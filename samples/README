Okay, boris is a slightly cleaned-up copy of the printer interface
script we use here at BU.  Since we were too lazy to rewrite it in
perl, we had to write pquota_user_admin.pl to do the dirty work.
It's actually a much bigger script, but we cut out all but the good
parts here.  (mostly because it was an ugly hack)        

We're running Solaris 2.6, and we've got an HP Laserjet 5simx. To
get to the relevant pquota crap here, just search for 'pquota' in
the file.
